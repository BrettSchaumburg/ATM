# ATM
 MIT Personalized ATM exercise

Developed as part of the MITxPro course in Full Stack Development with MERN, this is a simple ATM machine simulation. It allows users to perform basic ATM operations such as deposits and cashback transactions. It is made with React teaching us how to use states and do form checking.

Improvements made were as follows:
Added validation so users canâ€™t withdraw more money than the account balance
Added the inability to choose negative numbers as they are pointless with the implied use of depositing and withdrawls
Added the select field, modifying the user interface to require users to select deposit or withdraw before an input field is visible
Added minimal styling to all the elements, using a combination of Bootstrap and CSS
Created a warning label to show become visable if you do not have enough funds to make a withdrawl.
